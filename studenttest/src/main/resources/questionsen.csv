What is a constructor in Java?	1,2,3,4	When a new object is created, the program uses the appropriate constructor to do so.	A constructor is like a method. Its peculiarity lies in the fact that there is no returning element (including void), and its name is the same as the name of the class.	If no constructor is explicitly written, an empty constructor will be created automatically. The constructor can be overridden.	If a constructor with parameters was created, but you also need one without parameters, you need to write it separately, since it is not created automatically.
What is inheritance?	1	Inheritance means that one class can inherit (“extends”) another class. Thus, you can reuse the code from the class from which they are inherited.
What is polymorphism?	1,2	Polymorphism is the ability of a program to identically use objects with the same interface without knowing the specific type of that object. As they say, one interface, many implementations.	With the help of polymorphism, you can combine and use different types of objects according to their common behavior.
What are the features of Java?	1,2,3,4	OOP concepts: object orientation; inheritance; encapsulation; abstraction.	Cross-platform: A Java program can be run on any platform without any modifications. The only thing you need is an installed JVM (java virtual machine).	High performance: JIT(Just In Time compiler) enables high performance. JIT converts the bytecode to machine code and then the JVM starts execution. Multithreading: A thread of execution known as Thread. The JVM creates a thread called main thread. A programmer can create multiple threads by deriving from the Thread class or by implementing the Runnable interface.
What is encapsulation?	1	This is implementation hiding with access modifiers, with getters and setters. This is done in order to close access for external use in those places where the developers see fit.
